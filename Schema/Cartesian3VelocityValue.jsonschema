    "description": "A three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate and its derivative specified as `[X, Y, Z, vX, vY, vZ]`. If the array has six elements, the value is constant. If it has seven or more elements, they are time-tagged samples arranged as `[Time, X, Y, Z, vX, vY, vZ, Time, X, Y, Z, vX, vY, vZ, Time, X, Y, Z, vX, vY, vZ, ...]`, where Time is an ISO 8601 date and time string or seconds since epoch.",
